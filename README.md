# Auto_GLM_Pricing_w-freMTPL2

## Auto Insurance Pricing Study

This project implements a frequency–severity pricing framework using GLMs.

### Methods
- Poisson GLM for claim frequency with exposure offset
- Gamma GLM for claim severity
- Exposure-weighted pure premium aggregation

### Validation
Model diagnostics were performed by driver age and vehicle age, comparing modeled and observed pure premiums.

### Implementation
GLM outputs were converted into rating relativities
